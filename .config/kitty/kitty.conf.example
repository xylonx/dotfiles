#: Fonts {{{

#: kitty has very powerful font management. You can configure
#: individual font faces and even specify special fonts for particular
#: characters.

# font_family      monospace
# bold_font        auto
# italic_font      auto
# bold_italic_font auto

#: You can specify different fonts for the bold/italic/bold-italic
#: variants. The easiest way to select fonts is to run the `kitten
#: choose-fonts` command which will present a nice UI for you to
#: select the fonts you want with previews and support for selecting
#: variable fonts and font features. If you want to learn to select
#: fonts manually, read the font specification syntax
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/choose-fonts/#font-spec-
#: syntax>.

#: font_size 18.0

#: Font size (in pts).

# force_ltr no

#: kitty does not support BIDI (bidirectional text), however, for RTL
#: scripts, words are automatically displayed in RTL. That is to say,
#: in an RTL script, the words "HELLO WORLD" display in kitty as
#: "WORLD HELLO", and if you try to select a substring of an RTL-
#: shaped string, you will get the character that would be there had
#: the string been LTR. For example, assuming the Hebrew word ירושלים,
#: selecting the character that on the screen appears to be ם actually
#: writes into the selection buffer the character י. kitty's default
#: behavior is useful in conjunction with a filter to reverse the word
#: order, however, if you wish to manipulate RTL glyphs, it can be
#: very challenging to work with, so this option is provided to turn
#: it off. Furthermore, this option can be used with the command line
#: program GNU FriBidi <https://github.com/fribidi/fribidi#executable>
#: to get BIDI support, because it will force kitty to always treat
#: the text as LTR, which FriBidi expects for terminals.

# symbol_map

#: E.g. symbol_map U+E0A0-U+E0A3,U+E0C0-U+E0C7 PowerlineSymbols

#: Map the specified Unicode codepoints to a particular font. Useful
#: if you need special rendering for some symbols, such as for
#: Powerline. Avoids the need for patched fonts. Each Unicode code
#: point is specified in the form `U+<code point in hexadecimal>`. You
#: can specify multiple code points, separated by commas and ranges
#: separated by hyphens. This option can be specified multiple times.
#: The syntax is::

#:     symbol_map codepoints Font Family Name

# narrow_symbols

#: E.g. narrow_symbols U+E0A0-U+E0A3,U+E0C0-U+E0C7 1

#: Usually, for Private Use Unicode characters and some symbol/dingbat
#: characters, if the character is followed by one or more spaces,
#: kitty will use those extra cells to render the character larger, if
#: the character in the font has a wide aspect ratio. Using this
#: option you can force kitty to restrict the specified code points to
#: render in the specified number of cells (defaulting to one cell).
#: This option can be specified multiple times. The syntax is::

#:     narrow_symbols codepoints [optionally the number of cells]

# disable_ligatures never

#: Choose how you want to handle multi-character ligatures. The
#: default is to always render them. You can tell kitty to not render
#: them when the cursor is over them by using cursor to make editing
#: easier, or have kitty never render them at all by using always, if
#: you don't like them. The ligature strategy can be set per-window
#: either using the kitty remote control facility or by defining
#: shortcuts for it in kitty.conf, for example::

#:     map alt+1 disable_ligatures_in active always
#:     map alt+2 disable_ligatures_in all never
#:     map alt+3 disable_ligatures_in tab cursor

#: Note that this refers to programming ligatures, typically
#: implemented using the calt OpenType feature. For disabling general
#: ligatures, use the font_features option.

# font_features

#: E.g. font_features none

#: Choose exactly which OpenType features to enable or disable. Note
#: that for the main fonts, features can be specified when selecting
#: the font using the choose-fonts kitten. This setting is useful for
#: fallback fonts.

#: Some fonts might have features worthwhile in a terminal. For
#: example, Fira Code includes a discretionary feature, zero, which in
#: that font changes the appearance of the zero (0), to make it more
#: easily distinguishable from Ø. Fira Code also includes other
#: discretionary features known as Stylistic Sets which have the tags
#: ss01 through ss20.

#: For the exact syntax to use for individual features, see the
#: HarfBuzz documentation <https://harfbuzz.github.io/harfbuzz-hb-
#: common.html#hb-feature-from-string>.

#: Note that this code is indexed by PostScript name, and not the font
#: family. This allows you to define very precise feature settings;
#: e.g. you can disable a feature in the italic font but not in the
#: regular font.

#: On Linux, font features are first read from the FontConfig database
#: and then this option is applied, so they can be configured in a
#: single, central place.

#: To get the PostScript name for a font, use the `fc-scan file.ttf`
#: command on Linux or the `Font Book tool on macOS
#: <https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/79875/how-can-i-get-the-
#: postscript-name-of-a-ttf-font-installed-in-os-x>`__.

#: Enable alternate zero and oldstyle numerals::

#:     font_features FiraCode-Retina +zero +onum

#: Enable only alternate zero in the bold font::

#:     font_features FiraCode-Bold +zero

#: Disable the normal ligatures, but keep the calt feature which (in
#: this font) breaks up monotony::

#:     font_features TT2020StyleB-Regular -liga +calt

#: In conjunction with force_ltr, you may want to disable Arabic
#: shaping entirely, and only look at their isolated forms if they
#: show up in a document. You can do this with e.g.::

#:     font_features UnifontMedium +isol -medi -fina -init

# modify_font

#: Modify font characteristics such as the position or thickness of
#: the underline and strikethrough. The modifications can have the
#: suffix px for pixels or % for percentage of original value. No
#: suffix means use pts. For example::

#:     modify_font underline_position -2
#:     modify_font underline_thickness 150%
#:     modify_font strikethrough_position 2px

#: Additionally, you can modify the size of the cell in which each
#: font glyph is rendered and the baseline at which the glyph is
#: placed in the cell. For example::

#:     modify_font cell_width 80%
#:     modify_font cell_height -2px
#:     modify_font baseline 3

#: Note that modifying the baseline will automatically adjust the
#: underline and strikethrough positions by the same amount.
#: Increasing the baseline raises glyphs inside the cell and
#: decreasing it lowers them. Decreasing the cell size might cause
#: rendering artifacts, so use with care.

# box_drawing_scale 0.001, 1, 1.5, 2

#: The sizes of the lines used for the box drawing Unicode characters.
#: These values are in pts. They will be scaled by the monitor DPI to
#: arrive at a pixel value. There must be four values corresponding to
#: thin, normal, thick, and very thick lines.

# undercurl_style thin-sparse

#: The style with which undercurls are rendered. This option takes the
#: form (thin|thick)-(sparse|dense). Thin and thick control the
#: thickness of the undercurl. Sparse and dense control how often the
#: curl oscillates. With sparse the curl will peak once per character,
#: with dense twice. Changing this option dynamically via reloading
#: the config or remote control is undefined.

# underline_exclusion 1

#: By default kitty renders gaps in underlines when they overlap with
#: descenders (the parts of letters below the baseline, such as for y,
#: q, p etc.). This option controls the thickness of the gaps. It can
#: be either a unitless number in which case it is a fraction of the
#: underline thickness as specified in the font or it can have a
#: suffix of px for pixels or pt for points. Set to zero to disable
#: the gaps. Changing this option dynamically via reloading the config
#: or remote control is undefined.

# text_composition_strategy platform

#: Control how kitty composites text glyphs onto the background color.
#: The default value of platform tries for text rendering as close to
#: "native" for the platform kitty is running on as possible.

#: A value of legacy uses the old (pre kitty 0.28) strategy for how
#: glyphs are composited. This will make dark text on light
#: backgrounds look thicker and light text on dark backgrounds
#: thinner. It might also make some text appear like the strokes are
#: uneven.

#: You can fine tune the actual contrast curve used for glyph
#: composition by specifying up to two space-separated numbers for
#: this setting.

#: The first number is the gamma adjustment, which controls the
#: thickness of dark text on light backgrounds. Increasing the value
#: will make text appear thicker. The default value for this is 1.0 on
#: Linux and 1.7 on macOS. Valid values are 0.01 and above. The result
#: is scaled based on the luminance difference between the background
#: and the foreground. Dark text on light backgrounds receives the
#: full impact of the curve while light text on dark backgrounds is
#: affected very little.

#: The second number is an additional multiplicative contrast. It is
#: percentage ranging from 0 to 100. The default value is 0 on Linux
#: and 30 on macOS.

#: If you wish to achieve similar looking thickness in light and dark
#: themes, a good way to experiment is start by setting the value to
#: 1.0 0 and use a dark theme. Then adjust the second parameter until
#: it looks good. Then switch to a light theme and adjust the first
#: parameter until the perceived thickness matches the dark theme.

# text_fg_override_threshold 0

#: A setting to prevent low contrast between foreground and background
#: colors. Useful when working with applications that use colors that
#: do not contrast well with your preferred color scheme. The default
#: value is 0, which means no color overriding is performed. There are
#: two modes of operation:

#: A value with the suffix ratio represents the minimum accepted
#: contrast ratio between the foreground and background color.
#: Possible values range from 0.0 ratio to 21.0 ratio. For example, to
#: meet WCAG level AA
#: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines>
#: a value of 4.5 ratio can be provided. The algorithm is implemented
#: using HSLuv <https://www.hsluv.org/> which enables it to change the
#: perceived lightness of a color just as much as needed without
#: really changing its hue and saturation.

#: A value with the suffix % represents the minimum accepted
#: difference in luminance between the foreground and background
#: color, below which kitty will override the foreground color. It is
#: percentage ranging from 0 % to 100 %. If the difference in
#: luminance of the foreground and background is below this threshold,
#: the foreground color will be set to white if the background is dark
#: or black if the background is light.

#: WARNING: Some programs use characters (such as block characters)
#: for graphics display and may expect to be able to set the
#: foreground and background to the same color (or similar colors). If
#: you see unexpected stripes, dots, lines, incorrect color, no color
#: where you expect color, or any kind of graphic display problem try
#: setting text_fg_override_threshold to 0 to see if this is the cause
#: of the problem or consider using the ratio mode of operation
#: described above instead of the % mode of operation.

#: }}}

#: Text cursor customization {{{

# cursor #cccccc

#: Default text cursor color. If set to the special value none the
#: cursor will be rendered with a "reverse video" effect. Its color
#: will be the color of the text in the cell it is over and the text
#: will be rendered with the background color of the cell. Note that
#: if the program running in the terminal sets a cursor color, this
#: takes precedence. Also, the cursor colors are modified if the cell
#: background and foreground colors have very low contrast. Note that
#: some themes set this value, so if you want to override it, place
#: your value after the lines where the theme file is included.

# cursor_text_color #111111

#: The color of text under the cursor. If you want it rendered with
#: the background color of the cell underneath instead, use the
#: special keyword: `background`. Note that if cursor is set to none
#: then this option is ignored. Note that some themes set this value,
#: so if you want to override it, place your value after the lines
#: where the theme file is included.

# cursor_shape block

#: The cursor shape can be one of block, beam, underline. Note that
#: when reloading the config this will be changed only if the cursor
#: shape has not been set by the program running in the terminal. This
#: sets the default cursor shape, applications running in the terminal
#: can override it. In particular, shell integration
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/> in kitty sets
#: the cursor shape to beam at shell prompts. You can avoid this by
#: setting shell_integration to no-cursor.

# cursor_shape_unfocused hollow

#: Defines the text cursor shape when the OS window is not focused.
#: The unfocused cursor shape can be one of block, beam, underline,
#: hollow and unchanged (leave the cursor shape as it is).

# cursor_beam_thickness 1.5

#: The thickness of the beam cursor (in pts).

# cursor_underline_thickness 2.0

#: The thickness of the underline cursor (in pts).

# cursor_blink_interval -1

#: The interval to blink the cursor (in seconds). Set to zero to
#: disable blinking. Negative values mean use system default. Note
#: that the minimum interval will be limited to repaint_delay. You can
#: also animate the cursor blink by specifying an easing function. For
#: example, setting this to option to 0.5 ease-in-out will cause the
#: cursor blink to be animated over a second, in the first half of the
#: second it will go from opaque to transparent and then back again
#: over the next half. You can specify different easing functions for
#: the two halves, for example: -1 linear ease-out. kitty supports all
#: the CSS easing functions <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
#: US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function>. Note that turning on animations
#: uses extra power as it means the screen is redrawn multiple times
#: per blink interval. See also, cursor_stop_blinking_after. This
#: setting also controls blinking text, which blinks in exact rhythm
#: with the cursor.

# cursor_stop_blinking_after 15.0

#: Stop blinking cursor after the specified number of seconds of
#: keyboard inactivity. Set to zero to never stop blinking. This
#: setting also controls blinking text, which blinks in exact rhythm
#: with the cursor.

# cursor_trail 0

#: Set this to a value larger than zero to enable a "cursor trail"
#: animation. This is an animation that shows a "trail" following the
#: movement of the text cursor. It makes it easy to follow large
#: cursor jumps and makes for a cool visual effect of the cursor
#: zooming around the screen. The actual value of this option controls
#: when the animation is triggered. It is a number of milliseconds.
#: The trail animation only follows cursors that have stayed in their
#: position for longer than the specified number of milliseconds. This
#: prevents trails from appearing for cursors that rapidly change
#: their positions during UI updates in complex applications. See
#: cursor_trail_decay to control the animation speed and
#: cursor_trail_start_threshold to control when a cursor trail is
#: started.

# cursor_trail_decay 0.1 0.4

#: Controls the decay times for the cursor trail effect when the
#: cursor_trail is enabled. This option accepts two positive float
#: values specifying the fastest and slowest decay times in seconds.
#: The first value corresponds to the fastest decay time (minimum),
#: and the second value corresponds to the slowest decay time
#: (maximum). The second value must be equal to or greater than the
#: first value. Smaller values result in a faster decay of the cursor
#: trail. Adjust these values to control how quickly the cursor trail
#: fades away.

# cursor_trail_start_threshold 2

#: Set the distance threshold for starting the cursor trail. This
#: option accepts a positive integer value that represents the minimum
#: number of cells the cursor must move before the trail is started.
#: When the cursor moves less than this threshold, the trail is
#: skipped, reducing unnecessary cursor trail animation.

# cursor_trail_color none

#: Set the color of the cursor trail when cursor_trail is enabled. If
#: set to 'none' (the default), the cursor trail will use the cursor's
#: background color. Otherwise, specify a color value (e.g., #ff0000
#: for red, or a named color like 'red'). This allows you to customize
#: the appearance of the cursor trail independently of the cursor
#: color.

#: }}}

#: Scrollback {{{

# scrollback_lines 2000

#: Number of lines of history to keep in memory for scrolling back.
#: Memory is allocated on demand. Negative numbers are (effectively)
#: infinite scrollback. Note that using very large scrollback is not
#: recommended as it can slow down performance of the terminal and
#: also use large amounts of RAM. Instead, consider using
#: scrollback_pager_history_size. Note that on config reload if this
#: is changed it will only affect newly created windows, not existing
#: ones.

# scrollbar scrolled

#: Control when the scrollbar is displayed.

#: scrolled
#:     means when the scrolling backwards has started.
#: hovered
#:     means when the mouse is hovering on the right edge of the window.
#: scrolled-and-hovered
#:     means when the mouse is over the scrollbar region *and* scrolling backwards has started.
#: always
#:     means whenever any scrollback is present
#: never
#:     means disable the scrollbar.

# scrollbar_interactive yes

#: If disabled, the scrollbar will not be controllable via th emouse
#: and all mouse events will pass through the scrollbar.

# scrollbar_jump_on_click yes

#: When enabled clicking in the scrollbar track will cause the scroll
#: position to jump to the clicked location, otherwise the scroll
#: position will only move towards the position by a single screenful,
#: which is how traditional scrollbars behave.

# scrollbar_width 0.5

#: The width of the scroll bar in units of cell width.

# scrollbar_hover_width 1

#: The width of the scroll bar when the mouse is hovering over it, in
#: units of cell width.

# scrollbar_handle_opacity 0.5

#: The opacity of the scrollbar handle, 0 being fully transparent and
#: 1 being full opaque.

# scrollbar_radius 0.3

#: The radius (curvature) of the scrollbar handle in units of cell
#: width. Should be less than scrollbar_width.

# scrollbar_gap 0.1

#: The gap between the scrollbar and the window edge in units of cell
#: width.

# scrollbar_min_handle_height 1

#: The minimum height of the scrollbar handle in units of cell height.
#: Prevents the handle from becoming too small when there is a lot of
#: scrollback.

# scrollbar_hitbox_expansion 0.25

#: The extra area around the handle to allow easier grabbing of the
#: scollbar in units of cell width.

# scrollbar_track_opacity 0

#: The opacity of the scrollbar track, 0 being fully transparent and 1
#: being full opaque.

# scrollbar_track_hover_opacity 0.1

#: The opacity of the scrollbar track when the mouse is over the
#: scrollbar, 0 being fully transparent and 1 being full opaque.

# scrollbar_handle_color foreground

#: The color of the scrollbar handle. A value of foreground means to
#: use the current foreground text color, a value of
#: selection_background means to use the current selection background
#: color. Also, you can use an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or
#: red.

# scrollbar_track_color foreground

#: The color of the scrollbar track. A value of foreground means to
#: use the current foreground text color, a value of
#: selection_background means to use the current selection background
#: color. Also, you can use an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or
#: red.
